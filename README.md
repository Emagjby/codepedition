# CODEPEDITION

## 👀 Vision

**Codepedition** is an interactive learning platform that transforms traditional coding roadmaps into a gamified expedition. Through quest-style challenges, real-world projects, and visual progress tracking, Codepedition helps developers of all levels stay motivated, focused, and engaged while learning to code.
